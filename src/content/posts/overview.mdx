## Can I drink tap water?

No. Please only drink bottle water. 

Things to consider: 

- If you're ordering food or drinks from street vendors, please ensure that they are using bottled water and not tap water. 
- If you're brushing your teeth, try to avoid using tap water

A Typhoid vaccination significantly reduces your chances of being ill when exposed to bacteria within food/water.
