# Getting there

## Step 1: To Caticlan Island

Boracay does not have an airport. So the fastest route, is to first arrive in Caticlan via air or boat. Then transfer to Boracay by ferry.

Here is how to arrive in Caticlan.

| Option       | From   | To        | Duration | Cost     |
|--------------|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Flight       | Manila | Caticlan  | 1 hour   | <Currency>50</Currency>-<Currency>100</Currency>  |
| Flight       | Cebu   | Caticlan  | 1 hour   | <Currency>50</Currency>-<Currency>100</Currency>  |
| Ferry        | Manila | Caticlan  | 13 hours | <Currency>20</Currency>-<Currency>50</Currency>   |
| Ferry        | Cebu   | Caticlan  | 13 hours | <Currency>20</Currency>-<Currency>50</Currency>  |
| Bus + Ferry  | Manila | Caticlan  | 24 hours | <Currency>50</Currency>-<Currency>100</Currency>  |
| Bus + Ferry  | Cebu   | Caticlan  | 24 hours | <Currency>50</Currency>-<Currency>100</Currency>  |

My thoughts:

- Flight: This is the fastest and most convenient option for getting to Boracay. There are multiple flights available each day from Manila and Cebu to Caticlan Airport, which is located on the northern tip of Boracay Island.
- Ferry: This is a more affordable option than flying, but it takes longer. There are multiple ferries available each day from Manila and Cebu to Caticlan Jetty Port, which is located on the southern tip of Boracay Island. From the jetty port, you will need to take a short boat ride to Boracay Island.
- Bus + Ferry: This is the most affordable option for getting to Boracay, but it takes the longest. There are multiple buses available each day from Manila and Cebu to Caticlan. From Caticlan, you will need to take a ferry to Boracay Island.
